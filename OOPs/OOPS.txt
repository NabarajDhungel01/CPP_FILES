          Suitable for small program 

Eg 
Void main(){} // thats all

Modular Programming  dividing a program into functions and each function has a clear purpose.
Eg 


Void function();
Void main()
{
function(); // 
}

Problem :    in modular programming data remains alive within modules, so we need some data to be global .

Problem ::  if we use more global variable, if atm has function like withdrawal()  , withdrawal(),  getn.PIN()  mini stmt()    global variable : blc, pin, name, 
The issue is that we have global data into global variables and four functions are using all the data, so for the programmer it is harder to track where the value is getting from.

SO, in a large project , we have a very large number of functions and it becomes very difficult to track. Difficult to conceptualize. Difficult to modify.
 
The root cause is the function and data are separate from each other. So we need to bind them together 
So, with OOP we bind our function and data together maling the CLASS

Class is the collections of variable and functions:

Class

Name 
Pin
Balance 
Function
withdrawal()
chk_blc()
gen_PIN()
MINI_STMT()

The class is the blueprint of the object with the help of class , we can create the object 

It relates with real world like name pin balance  and their function are capable of using their own variable . like ram.name


ENCAPSULATION IS ENCAPSULATING ALL THINGS IN THE CLASS

			
	Private means we can only use inside the class only
	Private and public are class specifiers.  
	
	For member variable we write private, for member function we write public :




	
	ACCESS SPECIFIERS:
	

Class house 
{
private :
Int length, breadth;    // member variable
Public:
Void setData(int x, int y)
Void area()
{
{Cout << length*breadth;}
}


Private :
Int x;

Protected:
Int y

Public :
Int z




IF WE USE INHERITANCE, WE CAN USE THE FEATURE OF ANOTHER CLASS…
INheriting Class 1

Private :
Can’t access

Protected :
y=10;

Public :
z=20



Other : (LIKE FROM MAIN FUNCTION sita.name)
Private :
Can’t access

Protected:
Can’t access

Public :
z=20;






Charactersistsc os OOPs;




Class:
Class is a blueprint and object is instance of class
Class is user-defined data type which holds its own data members and member functions.
Helps in code reusability

Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is wrapping up variables and methods in class.
It help in data hiding
Polymorphism:
Function overloading is example 
The property in which a single is capable of performing multiple task and can exist in multiple forms is called polymorphism
Helps in reducing the complexity and length of code bcz we are not writing the functionalities aggain n again


Inheritance:
Inherit the properties of a parent class to child class
Like:-
We can create the Animal Class and 
Class Animal{string name, int legs, int age};
Inherit to the Dog, Cat,Cow.



Abstraction:
 Hiding complicated things from the user



OOP’s approach


Class- combine data and function together

Class is building  print

Class is user defined data type which holds its own member and member functions

Object is an instance of class, when created memory is allocated to member variables of member function




Access Sepcifiers

 Data hiding
Private
With same class
Protected
Within same class , inheriting class
Public 
Anywhere


Charactersistscs
Class Object
Encapsulation
Polymorphism(the same thing is capable of showing many forms helps in code reusability)
Inheritance
Abstraction - Data hiding simply



Constructors
		Boss (i have got critical assignment hat needs to be done with great precision)

- i give instructions to secretary
Secratary - Employee

Second way
Calling employee and giving him instructions face to face
- No intermediate


IN case 1:
- there is chance of misconception
It may convey improper info to employee
It is time consuming ( conveying same info twice)

IN case 2:
No erros as above



Lets take a example 


#include <iostream>
Class A
{
private:
Int age;
public:
//—----------------------------------------------
Void setData(int x =0)
{age =x;}
//—-----------------------------------------------
Int getData()
{return age;}
//—-----------------------------------------------
}

Void main()
{
A a_obj;
a_obj.setData(28);
Cout << a_obj.getData () ;
}


↑↑↑↑ This is without constructuors↑↑↑↑↑
==================================================================================================

↓↓↓↓ This is with the constructors ↓↓↓↓
#include <iostream>
Class A 
{ private :
Int age;
Public:
--------------------------------------------------
A (int x) // constructor
{  age = x };	// same name as class and dont return
—----------------------------------------------
Int getData ()
{ 
Return age;
}
Void main()
{
A a_obj ( 28) ;
Cout << a_obj.getData();
}


Why constructors??

Programmer may forget to initialize the data members in the object after creating it.
When there are many objects, then it would be a tedious job.
Initialize and allocate memory to data members

Rules:
Same Name as Class Name
No return type


Types:

Non - parameterized or Default
Parametrized constructor
Copy constructor

Non - Parameterized constructor

#include <iostream>
Class A
{
Private :
int age;
Public :
—------------------------------------
A()			// Non Parametrized constructor
{age = 0 }      // same name as class and don’t return anything
 	This is non parametrized constructor because it doesnt contain any parameters and used to set the default value in member variable.

Lets look  VS CODE file name oops1.cpp.
 
Key Takeaway from this program
In order to create non parametrized constructor, we will create the constructor with no arguments
And inside the body of constructors , we can leave it blank or we can give them certain values so that they doesnt contain any garbage values


Parameterized Constructor

It takes some arguments 
Eg:
#Include <iostream>
Class A
{
Private :
Int age ;
Public:
—----------------------------------------
A (int x) //  Parameterized constructor
{age = x;}  // same name as class and doesn’t return anything
—----------------------------------------
// The value  will be passed by the user as argument
Int getdata ()
{
Return Age;}

}
Void main ()
{
 A a_obj(28);
Cout << a_obj.getData ();
}


Lets hop on to VS CODE file name : oop2.cpp

Copy Constructor

Example:
You go to shop and ask for shopkeeper
I want the same shoe my friend has
Shopkeeper says “ how will i know your friend’s shoe”
What will i do
I will go to my frn and ask for shoe and show to shopkeeper
Now the shopkeeper will understand my requirement and he will give the copy of shoe
Similarly, in C++ , the copy constructor are used to create new object from the existing object

Example:
 #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class A
{
private:
    int age;
 
public:
    //----------------------------
    A(int x)
    {
        age = x; // Parameterized constructor
    }
    //----------------------------
    A( A &a_obj1)
    {
        age = a_obj1.age;
    }
 
int getData()
{
    return age;
}
};
 
int main()
{
 A a_obj1 (28) ; // Parameterized constructor
 
 A a_obj2 ( a_obj1 ); // Copy constructor
 
cout << a_obj2.getData();
 
}

We are using the & to say the compiler that we are using that variable as reference


HOP TO VS CODE :

Oops3.cpp


Overloaded Constructor

Example: // this code is also in the file oops4.cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
// class A
// {
// private:
// int age;
// public:
// //-------------------------------
// A ()                //   Non -Parameterized  Constructor
// { age =0;}
// //-------------------------------
// A (int x)               //  Parameterized  Constructor
// { age =x ;}}
// //-------------------------------
// A ( &obj1)                //  Copy Constructor  
// { age = a_obj1.age}
// //-------------------------------
// };
 
 
 
 
 
// Instead of creating separate non parameterized constructor , we will assign the value only in the parameterized constructor
// So the upper code becomes like this:
class A
{
private:
int age;
public:
//-------------------------------
A (int x=0)   // initializing with zero instead of initializing in no parameterized constructor            //  Parameterized  Constructor
{ age =x ;}
//-------------------------------
A (A &a_obj1)                //  Copy Constructor  
{ age = a_obj1.age;}
//-------------------------------
};
 
int main()
{
A a_obj1;
return 0;
}

OPERATOR OVERLOADING

We used to have bulk phone 
It was not portable that was problem
After years of rev. We came to button touch & screen touch mobiles
So we have overloaded the old calling feature of the phone to smartphone with better and latest features. 
Similarly, we were facing the problem in programming
The problem was the operator was only able to perform within the predefined data types like integers, floats, double , string
But it failed when user defined data types ( like st)
if we want to add two ints , it can do but when we want to add the two Objects, it loses its functionality
We want to make the “+” operator smart enough like the smartphone 

OPERATOR OVERLOADING IS NOTHING BUT MAKING IT WORK FOR THE USER DEFINED DATA TYPES LIKE OBJECTS AND STRUCTURES.

When we make operators (+,-,*,/) work for user-defined types like objects and structures. This is known as operator overloading. 


Example: oops5.cpp

// TRADUTIONAL ADDING THE VARIABLES OF OBJECTS
// OPERATOR OVERLOADING
// WAP TO add the weight using the traditional method
 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class A
{
private:
    int weight;
 
public:
    A(int x = 0)
    {
        weight = x;
    }
    A addWeight(A w2)
    {
        A temp;
        temp.weight = weight + w2.weight;
        return temp;
    }
    void getweight()
    {
        cout << "Weight " << weight;
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    int a = 63, b = 74, c = 0;
    c = a + b;
    /* here the c = a+b is the operation between the pre defined data types. but when we want to add the user defined data types
     it loses is capability
 
     We have two approach to add the two objects
     1. Traditional Approach
        -►in traditinal approach we create an addweight function to add
     2. Operator Overloading Approach
        -► In this menthod we do the operator overtloading
 
    */
 
    A person1(63);
    A person2(74);
    A total;
    total = person1.addWeight(person2); // either this or this ↓↓↓↓
    // total = person2.addWeight(person1);
    total.getweight();
}
 
Example : OOPS6.cpp
// OPERATOR OVERLOADING
// WAP TO add the weight using the operator overloading method
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class A
{ private:
    int weight;
public:
    A(int x = 0)
    { weight = x;  }
A operator + (A w2)
    { A temp;
        temp.weight = weight + w2.weight ;
       return temp; }
    void getweight(); };
int main()
{  int a = 63, b = 74, c = 0;
    c = a + b;
    A person1(63);
    A person2(74);
    A total;
    total = person1 + person2;
    total.getweight(); }
void A ::getweight()
{ cout << "Weight " << weight;}


Goto VS code
oops7.cpp

WAP to overload ++ Pre increment operator 








#Include <iostream>
Void main()
Int a =63;
++a;
Person(63);
++Jon; 	(wrong)
}


Class Person
{
Private:
Int wieght;
Public:
A (int x=0)
{ weight =x;}

PRE-INCREMENT OPERATOR OVERLOADING

void operator ++()
            {
                ++weight;
            }

Void operator ++()
{
++weight;
}

};

LETS HOP TO VS CODE
Oops8.cpp

POST-INCREMENT OPERATOR OVERLOADING
oops9.cpp


For post increment we pass the int as the argument
 // post increment
            void operator ++(int)
            {
                weight++;
            }



INHERITANCE 

What is inheritance?

►Grandfather←Father←Child
►► Parent Class ← Child Class 
THe class from which we are inheriting is called parent class / base class
THe class which is inheriting the class is called child class / derived class
So, inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of the another class.

Why inheritance ?

You are writing a test, u r preparing for test/exam
Your university modifies the curriculum and told you to write the exam again, i would be in definite problem
To conduct exam again, it is
Waste of time
Resource,cost
Not feasible
PROGRAMMING
Module (Initial) → Testing → Module (Final)
If someone says you to modify the initial module, it will be the problems as pointed above. 
So, in this situation , INHERITANCE helps

  M1 + feature

We can  create a new class by inheriting the old class + feature

INHERITANCE  APPROACH

	Base Model

+ Wheels
+ Seats 
+ Doors
+ Windows 
+ AC
+ Fuel Tank
+ Suspension
+ Transmission

+ PS				-  +   PS			- + PW +  PS
+ PW			-  + PW			- ABS +SR
+ ABS			-  +  ABS			- AutoTrans


	               ↑↑↑↑Car Variants ↑↑↑↑


We created the base model
And we inheriting the Base model and inheriting the base class to derived class to various version.

Why Inheritance?
Reduce Duplicate Code
Code Reuse
Better Organization of Code

INHERITANCE EXAMPLE
#Example 1:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class rectangle
{
    public:
    int length;
    int breadth;
 
    void show() // base class
    {  cout << length<< endl;
       cout << breadth<< endl;   }
};
 
// CREATING THE DERIVED CLASS
class cuboid:public rectangle // publicly inheriting the rectangle class
{
public :
int height;
void display()
{ cout << height << endl;}
};
int main()
{
    rectangle r;
    r.length= 10;
    r.breadth = 20;
    r.show();
 
    // INHERITED CLASS
   
    cuboid c;
    c.length = 10;
    c.breadth = 20;
    c.height = 30;
    c.show();
    c.display();
}


#Example 2:
WAP in which cuboid class inherit rectangle class and calculate area and volume
// project2.cpp



CONSTRUCTORS AND INHERITANCE

CONCEPT #1:
class base
{
Public:
base()
{  cout<< “Default of base class “;  }
 Base (int b )
{  cout << “ Parameterized of Base class : ;   }
};

class derived : public base
{
//Empty
};

Void main ()
{
derived d1;  // this will call default

derived d2(9);    // error happens    because only the default constructor can be called where there is no constructor in derived class 
// IF THERE IS NO CONSTRUCTOR IN DERIVED CLASS, THEN THE DERIVED CLASS WILL CALL THE CONSTRUCTORS FROM THE BASE CLASS 

}

NOTE : IF WE DON’T SPECIFY THE CONSTRUCTOR, THEN THE DERIVED CLASS WILL USE APPROPRIATE CONSTRUCTOR FROM THE BASECLASS. ( APPLICABLE TO ONLY DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR)


Goto vs code oops10.cpp

CONCEPT #2:

class base
{
public :
base(){ cout << “DEFAULT of base class “ <<endl;}
base(int b) { cout<< “ Parameterized of base class << endl ;}
};

class derived:public base
{
public :
derived () { cout << “default of derived class” << endl ;  }
derived () { cout << “ parameterized of base class “ << endl ; }
};

void main ()
{ derived d1;        //  this will first call the base default msg and derived base message first
 derived d2(9);    // this will also call the base default msg first and derived parameterized msg   // it will not call the parameterized constructor even if we are passing the parameters in it . the derived class cant see the parameterized constructor of the base class .
}

NOTE : - 1st Default constructor of base class, then default constructor of derived class is called
NOTE :- 2nd Parameterized constructor of base class is not called when para. constructor is present in derived class.
Hop to vs code oop11.cpp

CONCEPT #3:

How we can call the parameterized constructor of base class?

class base
{
public :
base(){ cout << “DEFAULT of base class “ <<endl;}
base(int b_arg) { cout<< “ Parameterized of base class << b_arg << endl ;}
};

class derived:public base
{
public :
derived () : base()    	// this is how we call the constructor of base class
{ cout << “Default of derived class “<< endl ;}

derived (int d_arg) : base (d_arg)
 { cout << “ parameterized of derived class “ << endl ; }
};

Void main ()
{
Derived d1;
Derived d2(9); // first the parameterized constructor of base class will be called, then, parameterized constructor of derived class is called.
}

OVERRIDING MEMBER FUNCTION

class base
{
public :
void msg() { cout << “base class” ;}
};

class derived : public base
{
public: 
void msg() { cout << “ derived class”;}
};
void main ()
{
base b ;
b.Msg();

derived c;
c.Msg();
}

// If we create the new function in the derived class with the same name as base class and if we call the function in this case msg () , the function from the derived class is called instead of base class because 
“  THE DERIVED CLASS IS MADE SO THAT WE CAN USE THE MODIFICATION FOR OUR COMFORT,  and here we have modified in the derived class. As a result, the function from the derived class is called.
this is called function overriding.


	NOTE : REDEFINING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF BASE CLASS INTO DERIVED CLASS, THEN IF WE CREATE OBJECT OF DERIVED CLAS 


What if i want to call the base function in the base class and i dont want to create the object of the base class 
FOR that , you can call using the following way


class base
{
public :
void msg() { cout << “base class” ;}
};

class derived : public base
{
public: 
void msg() { 
cout << “ derived class”;
base::Msg(); // calling 
}
};
void main ()
{

derived c;
c.Msg();
}

Relations:

isA Car 
                                              

	    

lets see a example
class Suzuki
{
public:
vois chechis ()
{ //……………………… }
void engine()
{ //……………………… }
void suspension()
{ //……………………… }
void transmission()
{ //……………………… }
void doors()
{ //……………………… }
};






class DODO:public Suzuki
{
public:
void chechis() // function overriding
{ //…………modified…………… }
void doors()    // function overriding
{ //…………modified…………… }
void ABS			// added new feature
{ //…………modified…………… }
};


TAKEAWAY : In isA relationship we use inheritance bcz we dont want to create the class from the scratch 

hasA Relationship


class Suzuki
{
public:
vois chechis ()
{ //……………………… }
void engine()
{ //……………………… }
void suspension()
{ //……………………… }
void transmission()
{ //……………………… }
void doors()
{ //……………………… }
};



class Antoinette // company that used to produce engine for the plane but now it       //                        //is creating the engine for the cars
{
void V8_Engine( )
{
   //………………………………………….
}
void V6_Engine( )
{
   //………………………………………….
}
};

Now i want to create my own car such that two use some specific feature from above two classes
Now instead of inheriting we create the object of the above two classes


class DODO
{ 
private:
Suzuki design_obj;
Antoinette anto_obj;

public:
void addChechis()
{ design_obj.chechis();}

void addEngine()
{ anto_obj.V8_Engine();}

};


The benefit of doing this is we donot expose all data to the DODO class
So, we can avoid unnecessary exposure of the things


Lets suppose Suzuki gives me access to create by own car by using its features
When i use isA relationship , i can use all the features freely
But, when i use hasA relationship, we use objects thats useful for us





Ways of Inheritance

Private			class Parent
Protected
Public


Private			class child:public Parent
Protected
Public


Private			class grandchild:public child
Protected
Public

Child and grandchild would not be able to access Private 
Child and grandchild would be able to access both protected and public 
Protected would be inherited as Protected
AND
Public would be inherited as Public in Child and Grandchild




Protected Inheritance:-
Protected and Public in Parent class would be inherited as a Protected in in Child and GrandChild classes


NOTE :- While inheriting as protected, public  will also be inherited as protected.





Polymorphism

Base class pointer and Derived Class Object?

Base* ptr = NULL;


ptr = new Derived();



	Here there may be confusion that the pointer of base class and the object is of derived class
does it throw any error

bcz the pointer of base class is well compatible with the obj of der.class





		Basic Car
	               	↑
		Advance Car


pointer is of basic car
obj is of advance car
we are sitting in basic car and saying to advance car that this is also advance car
Can we access the feature of ferrari ?
=> no

class basicCar
{
public:
	void body();
	void door();
	void windows();
	vid tyres);
}

void advVar: public basicCar
{
public:
	void ABS();
void PS();
void EngineV8();
void AT();
}

void main()
{
basicCar *ptr;
ptr = new advVar();
}

//-Even if the pointer points to obj of adv car, it cant use the feature of //advance car

	// this ptr can only use the feature of base class
	

/*	//right
	ptr->body();
	ptr->doors();
	ptr->windows();
	ptr->tyres();

	// wrong
	ptr->ABS();
	ptr->PS();
	ptr->EngineV8();
	ptr->AT();
*/
}




 
Virtual Function

Virtual means existing in appearance but not in reality

Virtual funcion means fun. existing in class can’t be used


=> Program that appears to be calling a function of one class may in reality be calling a function of different class.


class Derv1:public base
{
public:
void show()
{
cout << “Derived1”;
}


class Derv2:public base
{
public:
void show()
{
cout << “Derived2”;
}


class base
{
public:
void show()
{
cout << “Base”;
}

void main()
{
Derv1 dv1;
Derv2 dv2;

base *ptr;
ptr = &dv1;
ptr->show();
}


Let’s hop to VS CODE	oops14.cpp



// after adding virtual infront of show function in base class, it can now access the drv1 & drv2 show function


First, the drv1 and drv2 can’t access their own function through ptr;
Now, to make them access their own function, we make the base show function as virtual as below
syntax : virtual void show(){ cout << “base”;}
Now ,the base show() function becomes virtual and compiler will understand and show the drv1/drv2 show function 


Why Virtual Function?


Example:
U m owner of candy shop
Today is aniv.
you hv dec to gib candy to kids who are regular
now whenever kids appear, u will decide which candy to gib to them
like blue to girl red to boy
u cant predict how many boys/girls ll appear
Such example also comes in programming, where we cannot predict which object will come next and at run time compiler will decide

Thats why we use virtual function
This is called Late Binding.

Compiler defer the decision until the program is running
And at runtime when it come to know which class is pointed by PTR, then appropriate function would be called.
This is called Dynamic Binding  / Late Binding

class person {  public:
virtual void give() { cout << “Bun “;  } };


class girl:public person{  public:
void give() { cout << “Blue Bun “;  } };

class boy:public person{  public:
 void give() { cout << “Red Bun “;  } };

void main ()
{
boy b1;
girl g1;
person*ptr = NULL;	// initializing with null

ptr = &b1;
ptr->give();

ptr = &g1;
ptr->give();
}


Abstract Class

Abstract class is used when we never want to instantiate an object of BASE class.

When we want to esure that object of base class is never instantiated is never generated , then we use abstract class

 WE WANT TO ESNURE THAT  THE OBJECT OF BASE CLASS is never generated.
we just have to write virtual infront of the function which is common to allother derived class of this class and write = 0 
syntax:   virtual void give() = 0;

class Person{
public:
virtual void give() =0; // 0 means we dont want to instantiate
};

class boy: public Person {
public:
void give(){ cout << “brown bun”;}};

class girl: public Person{
public:
void giv(){cout <<”pink bun”}};



Pure virtual function
=> when the put the virtual function to 0, it becomes the pure virtual function, 

WHEN WE MAKE THE VIRTUAL FUNCTION IT DOESNT HAVE BODY
And if a pure virtual function exists in a class then that class becomes abstract class

e

WHY ABSTRACT CLASS?
  It exists only to act as parent of derived class

To ensure that ,the base class will do nothing and only act as a parent , we make it abstract class
To ensure that the object of parent/ base class never exists


Let’s see the main function
void main(){
boy b1;
girl g1’
Person *ptr = NULL;

ptr=&b1;
ptr->give();

ptr=&g1;
ptr->give();

ptr=&b1;
ptr->give();
}

HOP TO VS CODE  oops15.cpp



when we call the function ,  it will select the functionality acc to the reference stored inside the pointer variable.

Moreover, giver() function is performing more than one task.
in class girl, it is selecting the pink bun and in class boy it is selecting the brown bun.


  
So, This ability to perform  more than one task of a same function is polymorphism.
Anything that exists in more than one form  is polymorphism



TAKEAWAY:
When one thing exists in more than one form and when that same functionality behaves diffly acc to input value, so this feature of shopwing more than one form is polymorphism
